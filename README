Experimental Frontend Under DHCP with Cloud Init
------------------------------------------------


This is a development test of running rocks with cloud-init 
and DHCP on the public interface.

To run this roll you need at least Rocks 6.2 (with the 
rocks run reconfigure).

After installing the roll with the standard procedure you 
should shutdown the frontend and then at the next 
reboot the machine will try to dhcp from the public 
interface.

The private interface problems have not been addressed yet.
